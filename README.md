# featurize

A simple Python wrapper for Tensorflow that allows users to quickly and intuitively generate feature vectors from images using a pre-trained convolutional neural network! These extracted feature vectors can be used for any number of tasks, such as clustering, segmentation, or further object recognition using different learning algorithms. 

This library is meant to serve as an alternative to [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/), where it is also possible to also extract feature vectors from various layers, but involves a great deal of overhead in simply correctly installing Caffe. It is also possible to perform feature extraction using pre-trained models in MATLAB, but this library aims at being simple and python-centric to hopefully appeal to a wider audience. For those interested in these alternatives check out the [Caffe feature extraction](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/gathered/examples/feature_extraction.html) and the [MATLAB feature extraction](https://www.mathworks.com/examples/matlab-computer-vision/mw/vision_product-DeepLearningImageClassificationExample-image-category-classification-using-deep-learning) guides. 

## Installation

TODO: Will be available as a pip module for easy installation. 

## Usage

TODO: A full API will soon be written.
