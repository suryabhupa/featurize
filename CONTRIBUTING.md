## Feature Requests

Want to see a feature in featurize that you think would help people out? Submit a [feature request](https://github.com/suryabhupa/featurize/issues/new)! 

If you're itching to implement this idea yourself, feel free to [fork](https://github.com/suryabhupa/featurize/fork) this repo:

1. Create your feature branch: `git checkout -b my-new-feature`
2. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
3. Push to the branch: `git push origin my-new-feature`
4. Submit a pull request! 

It is still recommended that before you submit a pull request, you should [open an issue](https://github.com/suryabhupa/featurize/issues/new) to see what kind of feedback you receive, so we don't have wasted efforts and to ensure that your code is incorporated into the code base. 

## Bugs, Fixes, and Patches

Found something wrong with featurize? Bug reports and fixes are greatly appreciated. 

Feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/suryabhupa/featurize/issues/new) describing what exactly went wrong, including the full error message, version number, and any other information you think might be useful in helping us debug your issue. In addition, if there are [open issues](https://github.com/suryabhupa/featurize/issues), feel free to work on those as well! This is likely the best way to help to contribute to this project.

## List of upcoming features

This is a tentative list of features that I would love to see incorporated in featurize in the near future. I or others may be working on these features in separate branches, so check those out, or submit a pull request!

1. Nice looking progress bars showing how many images have been featurized, how many are left, and the estimated time to completion (similar to [xlua](https://github.com/torch/xlua)'s progress bar)
2. Support for different pre-trained convolutional neural networks
3. Demos demonstrating functionality and utility of feature vectors!
